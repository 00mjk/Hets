Description: Package containing the core of Hets - the Heterogeneous Tool Set.
 Hets is a parsing, static analysis and proof management tool combining
 various tools for different specification languages, thus providing a
 tool for the heterogeneous specification language HetCASL. The structuring
 constructs of this language are those of CASL, plus some new heterogeneous
 constructs for indicating the language and for language translations. Hence,
 Hets is based on a graph of logics and languages.
