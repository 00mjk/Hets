This is the first attempt at creating a Haskell-Datatype for Omdoc-structures.

To read in an Omdoc-document import 'Omdoc.hs' and do something similar to :
	myOmdoc <- (fReadXml "file.omdoc")::(IO Omdoc)

To write an Omdoc-structure to a file :
	fWriteXml "file.omdoc" myOmdoc

The state of developement is currently experimental. Reading in a file and writing it back does not always result in equivalent data (see 'examples' directory for some information).
