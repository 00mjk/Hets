DriFT v1.0, nhc98 Version
-------------------------

This tar file contains

Makefile			- to build derive
*.hs,*.lhs			- DrIFT source code
/example			- simple example file to test derive on.

Changes from original
---------------------
  (Changes by Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk, 1999)
Updated sources to Haskell 98.  Added derivation of class Binary.
Changed Main.main to place results on stdout instead of overwriting
original file.  Have not tried using Makefile recently; I use hmake
instead.

Building DrIFT
---------------
just type
   hmake DrIFT

Installation
------------
copy the 'DrIFT' executable to somewhere on your path

set DERIVEPATH to the list of directories you wish to search for  for
modules / interfaces. 

DERIVEPATH is quite fussy about the format the list should take :-
* each path should be separated by ':'
* no space inserted anywhere
* no final '/' on the end of a path

e.g. 
good - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs

bad - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs/
