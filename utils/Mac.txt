The gtk-2.14 framework can be used under Snow Leopard after:
- adding the pkg-config of the framework to the PATH

- cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools

- adding ~/.cabal/bin to the PATH

- add -m32 to gcc

  gcc -m32 $@

- cabal install gtk-0.11.2
  gtk-0.12.0 does not work!
  The gio package is not necessary, but it will be installed
  when installing glade (even if gtk was installed without by:
  cabal install gtk-0.11.2 -f -have-gio).

- cabal install glade-0.11.1

http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg
has pango-1.26.2 that is rejected by pango.cabal.
(Changing pango.cabal seems to work, though.)

gtk+-2.0 and libglade2 from Macports will work, too.
For linking -L/usr/lib should be added to ghc's command line
otherwise the wrong libiconv is used for the base and haskeline package.

quartz-gtk was tried several times without success.
uDrawGraph and (Aqua-) tcl/tk work without X (and uDrawGraph will not change)

ghc-6.10.4 does not work with the wai-extra cabal package
ghc-6.12.3 does not exist in 64Bit mode
ghc-7.10.1 does not support programatica #884
