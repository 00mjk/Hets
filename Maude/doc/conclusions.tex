Conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item Although we have studied more complex institutions and comorphisms,
we use the current one because Maude doesn't map labels in views.
\end{itemize}

Future work
\begin{itemize}
\item Prefix notation for Maude modules.
\item Comorphisms in the other direction (which implies using Maude
as prover).
\item Maude + Modal logic
\item strat and frozen attributes. Co-algebraic constructions.
\item more libraries(?)/improve the current ones(?)
\item More complex institution/comorphism.
\end{itemize}
