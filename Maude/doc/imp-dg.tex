We describe in this section the main functions used to draw the
development graph for Maude specifications. The main function is
\verb"anaMaudeFile", that receives a record of all the options received
from the command line (of type \verb"HetcatsOpts") and the path of
the Maude file to be parsed and return a pair with the library
name and its environment.

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
anaMaudeFile :: HetcatsOpts -> FilePath -> IO (Maybe (LIB_NAME, LibEnv))anaMaudeFile _ file = do    dg <- directMaudeParsing file    let name = Lib_id $ Direct_link "Maude_Module" nullRange    return $ Just (name, Map.singleton name dg)
\end{verbatim}
}

This environment is computed with the function
\verb"directMaudeParsing", that receives the file path and returns
a development graph. This analysis is performed in different stages:
First, the parser described in Section \ref{subsec:lex-parser}
Then, Maude is executed with \verb"runInteractiveCommand" to use
the parser described in Section \ref{subsec:maude-parser}

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
directMaudeParsing :: FilePath -> IO DGraphdirectMaudeParsing fp = do              ns <- parse fp              let ns' = either (\ _ -> []) id ns              (hIn, hOut, _, _) <- runInteractiveCommand maudeCmd              hPutStrLn hIn $ "load " ++ fp              ms <- traverseNames hIn hOut ns'              hPutStrLn hIn "in Maude/hets.prj"              psps <- predefinedSpecs hIn hOut              sps <- traverseSpecs hIn hOut ms              hClose hIn              hClose hOut              return $ insertSpecs (psps ++ sps) Map.empty Map.empty [] emptyDG
\end{verbatim}
