We describe in this section how Maude structuring mechanisms
described in Section \ref{sec:maude}
are translated into development graphs. Then, we explain how these development
graphs are normalized to deal with freeness constraints.

\subsection{Parameterized modules}

As we have seen in Section \ref{subsec:pmod}, parameterized modules 
receive a list of parameters $P_i$ each one associated to a module
expression $M_i$. Since these module expressions are theories, they
can have sorts that are not instantiated yet, so to avoid clash of
names these sorts are qualified with the parameter name. These
qualifications induce an implicit morphism in the definition links
of the development graph between the theory and the parameterized
module.

\subsection{Module expressions}\label{subsec:me}

Maude module expressions allow to combine and modify the information
contained in Maude modules.

\begin{itemize}
\item The summation expression of the module expressions $\mathit{ME}_1$ and
$\mathit{ME}_2$ generates a new node in the development graph
$(\mathit{ME}_1 + \mathit{ME}_2)$ with
the union of the information in both expressions. A definition link
is also created between the original expressions and the resulting one.
\item The renaming expression $\mathit{ME} * (R)$ creates a morphism with
the information given in $R$ that will be used in the link 
\item The instantiation module expression\footnote{This module expression
cannot be used in Core Maude in all places where the rest of expressions
can be used, for more information see \cite{maude-book}} assigns a view
or a parameter to each of the

Note that an instantiation generates some implicit morphisms and modifies
the ones stated in the views:
\begin{itemize}
\item When the parameter is instantiated with a view
\item As explained in the previous section, parameterized modules can
define sorts of the form \verb"name{X1, ..., Xn}", where \verb"X1, ..., Xn"
are parameter names that can be instantiated or bound by new parameters.
Thus, in addition to the morphism
\end{itemize}

\item When the module expression is a simple identifier the development
graph remains unchanged.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Importations}

Each Maude module generates two nodes in the development
graph. The first one contains the theory equipped with the usual
loose semantics. The second one, linked
to the first one with a free definition link (whose signature morphism
is detailed below), contains the same signature but
no local axioms and stands for the free models of the theory.
Note that Maude theories only generate one node, since their initial
semantics is not used by Maude specifications.
When importing a module, we will select the node used depending on the
chosen importation mode:
\begin{itemize}

\item
The \verb"protecting" mode generates a non-persistent free link between
the current node and the node standing for the free semantics of the
included one. 

\item
The \verb"extending" mode generates a global link with the annotation
\textsf{PCons?}, that stands for proof-theoretic conservativity and that
can be checked with a special conservativity checker that is
integrated into \Hets.

\item
The \verb"including" mode generates a global definition link between the
current node  and the node standing for the loose semantics of the
included one.
\end{itemize}

The summation module expression generates a new node that includes all 
the information in its summands. Note that this new node can also need
a node with its free model if it is imported in protecting mode.

\subsection{Views}\label{subsec:dg_views}

Maude views have a theory as source and either a module or a theory
as target. All the sorts and operators declared in the source theory
have to be mapped to sorts and operators in the target

A particular case of mapping between operators is the mapping between
terms, that has the general form \emph{op $e$ to term $t$}
where $e$ is a term consisting of a 
single operator applied to variables declared either on-the-fly or with
variable declarations in the same view and the target term is any term
with variables, those in the source $e$ in the corresponding sorts
resulting from the mapping.
Since this shortcut allows to map operators with different profiles,




%%%%%% PAPER

Signature morphisms are produced in different ways; explicitly, 
renaming of module expressions and  views lead to signature
morphisms; however, implicitly we also find other morphisms:
the sorts defined in the theories are qualified
with the parameter in order to distinguish sorts with the same name that
will be instantiated later by different ones; moreover, sorts defined
(not imported) in parameterized modules can be parameterized as well,
so when the theory is instantiated with a view these sorts are also
renamed (e.g. the sort \verb"List{X}" for generic lists can become
\verb"List{Nat}").

The model class of parameterized modules
consists of free extensions of the models of their parameters, that are
persistent on sorts, but not on kinds. This notion of freeness has been 
studied in \cite{BouhoulaJM00} under assumptions like existence of top sorts for kinds
and sorted variables in formulas; our results hold under similar
hypotheses. Thus,
we use the same non-persistent free links described for protecting
importation to link these modules with their corresponding theories.

%case, the parameter signature is taken to be empty).
%
Views do not generate nodes in the development graph but theorem links
between the node corresponding to the source theory and the node with
the free model of the target. However, Maude views
provide a special kind of mapping between terms, that can in general
map functions of different arity. When this mapping is used we generate
a new inner node extending the signature of the target to include functions
of the adequate arity.

We illustrate how to build the development graph with an example. Consider
the following Maude specifications:

{\codesize
\begin{verbatim}
fmod M1 is                                         fmod M2 is
 sort S1 .                                           sort S2 .
 op _+_ : S1 S1 -> S1 [comm] .                     endfm
endfm

th T is                                            mod M3{X :: T} is
 sort S1 .                                          sort S4 .
 op _._ : S1 S1 -> S1 .                            endm
 eq V1:S1 . V2:S1 = V2:S1 . V1:S1 [nonexec] . 
endth

mod M is                                           view V from T to M is
 ex M1 + M2 * (sort S2 to S) .                      op _._ to _+_ .
endm                                               endv
\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.47]{dg}
\caption{Development Graph for Maude Specifications\label{fig:dg}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent \Hets builds the graph shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dg},
where the following steps take place:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each module has generated a node with its name and
another primed one that contains the initial model, while both of them
are linked with a non-persistent free link. Note that theory \verb"T" did not
generate this primed node.
\item The summation expression has created a new node that includes the theories
of \verb"M1" and \verb"M2", importing the latter with a renaming; this new
node, since it is imported in \verb"extending" mode, uses a link with the
\textsf{PCons?} annotation.
\item There is a theorem link between \verb"T" and the free (here: initial) model of
\verb"M". This link is labeled with the mapping defined in the view \verb"V".
\item The parameterized module \verb"M3" includes the theory of its parameter
with a renaming, that qualifies the sort. Note that these nodes are connected
by means of a non-persistent freeness link.
\end{itemize}

It is straightforward to show:
\begin{theorem}
The translation of Maude modules into development graphs is
semantics-preserving. %\ednote{Undefined semantics-preserving}
\end{theorem}

Once the development graph is built, we can apply the (logic
independent) calculus rules that reduce global theorem links to local
theorem links, which are in turn discharged by local theorem proving
\cite{MAH-05-a}.  This can be used to prove Maude views, like e.g.\
``natural numbers are a total order.''  We show in the next
section how we deal with the freeness constraints imposed by free 
definition links.

\subsection{Normalization of free definition links}
\label{sec:free}

Maude uses initial and free semantics intensively. The semantics of
freeness is, as mentioned, different from the one used in \CASL in
that the free extensions of models are required to be persistent
only on sorts and new error elements can be added on the
interpretation of kinds. Attempts to design the translation to \CASL
in such a way that Maude free links would be translated to usual free
definition links in \CASL have been unsuccessful. We decided thus to
introduce a special type of links to represent Maude's freeness in
\CASL.  In order not to break the development graph calculus, we need
a way to normalize them. The idea is to replace them with a
semantically equivalent development graph in \CASL. The main idea is
to make a free extension persistent by duplicating parameter sorts
appropriately, such that the parameter is always explicitly included
in the free extension.

For any Maude signature $\Sigma$, let us define
an extension $\Sigma^\# = (S^\#, \leq^\#, F^\#, P^\#)$ of the
translation $\Phi(\Sigma)$ of $\Sigma$ to \CASL as follows:

\begin{itemize}

 \item $S^\#$ unites with the sorts of $\Phi(\Sigma)$ the set 
       $\{[s] \mid s \in Sorts(\Sigma)\}$;

 \item $\leq^\#$ extends the subsort relation $\leq$ with pairs
       $(s, [s])$ for each sort $s$ and $([s],[s'])$ for any sorts $s \leq s'$;

 \item $F^\#$ adds the function symbols $\{f:[w] \rightarrow [s]\}$ for all
       function symbols on sorts $f:w \rightarrow s $;\footnote{$[x_1 \ldots x_n]$
       is defined to be $[x_1] \ldots [x_n]$.}
 \item $P^\#$ adds the predicate symbol $rew$ on all new sorts.
\end{itemize}

Now, we consider a Maude non-persistent free definition link and let
$\sigma: \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma'$ be the morphism labeling it.%
\footnote{In Maude, this would usually be an injective renaming.}
We define a \CASL signature morphism 
 $\sigma^\# : \Phi(\Sigma) \rightarrow \Sigma'^\#$: on sorts, 
 $\sigma^\#(s) := \sigma^{sort}(s)$ and $\sigma^\#([s]):=[\sigma^{sort}(s)]$;
 on operation symbols, we can define $\sigma^ \#(f) := 
 \sigma^{op}(f)$ and this is correct because the operation symbols were
 introduced in $\Sigma'^\#$; $rew$ is mapped identically.


The normalization of Maude freeness is then illustrated in Fig.\ref{nf}.
Given a free non-persistent definition link $\flinka{M}{\sigma}{N}$, with 
$\sigma:\Sigma\rightarrow \Sigma_N$, we first take the translation of the nodes
to \CASL (nodes $M'$ and $N'$) and then introduce a new node, $K$, labeled with 
$\Sigma^\#_N$, a global definition link from $M'$ to $M''$ labeled with the 
inclusion $\iota_N$ of $\Sigma_N$ in $\Sigma^\#_N$, a free definition link from 
$M''$ to $K$ labeled with 
$\sigma^\#$ and a hiding definition link from $K$ to $N'$ labeled with the
inclusion $\iota_N$.\footnote{The arrows without labels in Fig.\ref{nf} 
correspond to heterogeneous links from Maude to \CASL.}

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}[0cm]{3.5cm}
\xymatrix{
M \ar@{=>}[rr]_{n.p.free}^{\sigma} \ar@{=>}[d]& & N \ar@{=>}[dd]\\
M'\ar@{=>}[d]^{\iota_N}& & \\
M''\ar@{=>}[r]_{free}^{\sigma^\#} & K \ar@{=>}[r]_{hide}^{\iota_n} & N'
}
\caption{Normalization of Maude free links}\label{nf}

\end{wrapfigure}

Notice that the models of $N$ are Maude reducts of \CASL models of $K$, 
reduced along the inclusion $\iota_N$. 

The next step is to eliminate \CASL free definition links. 
The idea is to use then a transformation specific to the second-order 
extension of \CASL to normalize freeness. 
The intuition behind this construction is that
it mimics the quotient term algebra construction,
that is, the free model is specified as the homomorphic image
of an absolutely free model (i.e.\ term model).

We are going to make use of the following known facts \cite{Reichel87}:

\begin{fact}

Extensions of theories in Horn form admit free extensions of models.

\end{fact}

\begin{fact}

Extensions of theories in Horn form are monomorphic.

\end{fact}

Given a free definition link $\flinka{M}{\sigma}{N}$, with 
$\sigma:\Sigma\rightarrow \Sigma^N$ such that $Th(M)$ is in Horn 
form, replace it with 
\xymatrix{
M \ar@{=>}[r]^{incl} &
K \ar@{=>}[r]^{incl}_{hide} &
N'
}, where $N'$ has the same signature as $N$, $incl$ denotes inclusions and 
the node $K$ is constructed as follows. 

The signature $\Sigma^K$ consists of the signature $\Sigma^M$ disjointly 
united with a copy of $\Sigma^M$, denoted $\iota(\Sigma_M)$ which makes all function symbols total 
(let us denote $\iota(x)$ the corresponding symbol in this copy for each
symbol $x$ from the signature $\Sigma^M$) and augmented with new operations 
$h: \iota(s) \rightarrow ?s$, for any sort $s$ of $\Sigma^M$ and 
$make_s:s\rightarrow \iota(s)$, for any sort $s$ of the source
signature $\Sigma$ of the morphism $\sigma$  labelling the free definition link.

The axioms $\psi^K$ of the node $K$ consist of:

\begin{itemize}

\item
sentences imposing the bijectivity of \textit{make};

\item axiomatization of the sorts in $\iota(\Sigma_M)$ as free types
with all operations as constructors, including $make$ for the sorts
in $\iota(\Sigma)$;

\item homomorphism conditions for $h$:
 $$ h(\iota(f)(x_1, \dots, x_n)) = f(h(x_1), \dots, h(x_n)) $$
 
and

$$\iota(p)(t_1, \dots, t_n) \Rightarrow p(h(t_1), \dots, h(t_n))$$

\item surjectivity of homomorphisms:

$$\forall y : s . \exists x:\iota(s) . h(x) \EEQ y$$

\item a second-order formula saying that the kernel of $h$ is the least
partial predicative congruence\footnote
{A partial predicative congruence consists of a symmetric 
and transitive binary relation for each sort and a relation
of appropriate type for each predicate symbol.} satisfying
$Th(M)$. This is done by quantifying over a predicate symbol for each sort
for the binary relation and one predicate symbol for each relation symbol
as follows: 

$$\begin{array}{l}
 \forall \{P_s : \iota(s),  \iota(s)\}_{s \in Sorts(\Sigma_M)} ,
           \{P_{p:w} : \iota(w)\} _{p:w \in \Sigma_M} \\
 .~ 
\mathit{symmetry}
 \land \mathit{transitivity}
 \land  \mathit{congruence}
\land \mathit{satThM}
\implies \mathit{largerThenKerH}
\end{array}
$$

where $\mathit{symmetry}$ stands for
$$\bigwedge_{s\in Sorts(\Sigma^M)} \forall x:{\iota(s)},y:{\iota(s)}.P_s(x,y)\implies P_s(y, x),$$
$\mathit{transitivity}$ stands for
$$\bigwedge_{s\in Sorts(\Sigma^M)} \forall x:{\iota(s)},y:{\iota(s)},z:{\iota(s)}.P_s(x, y)\land P_s(y, z)\implies P_s(x, z),$$
$\mathit{congruence}$ stands for
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\bigwedge_{f_{w\rightarrow s}\in\Sigma^M} \forall x_1\ldots x_n:{\iota(w)},y_1\ldots y_n:{\iota(w)}\,.\,\,\\
D(\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{x}))\land D(\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{y}))\land P_w(\bar{x},\bar{y})
\implies P_s(\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{x}),\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{y}))
\end{array}
$$ 

and

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\bigwedge_{p_w \in\Sigma^M} \forall x_1\ldots x_n:{\iota(w)},y_1\ldots y_n:{\iota(w)}\,.\,\,\\
D(\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{x}))\land D(\iota(f_{w,s})(\bar{y}))\land P_w(\bar{x},\bar{y})
\implies P_{p:w}(\bar{x}) \Leftrightarrow P_{p:w}(\bar{y})
\end{array}
$$
\noindent where $D$ indicates definedness. $\mathit{satThM}$ stands for
$$Th(M)[\EEQ/P_s; p:w/P_{p:w}; D(t)/P_s(t,t); t=u/P_s(t,u)\lor(\neg P_s(t,t)\land\neg P_s(u,u))]$$
where, for a set of formulas $\Psi$, $\Psi[sy_1/sy'_1;\ldots ;sy_n/sy'_n]$
denotes the simultaneous substitution of $sy'_i$ for $sy_i$ in
all formulas of $\Psi$ (while possibly instantiating the meta-variables
$t$ and $u$).
%
Finally $\mathit{largerThenKerH}$ stands for
$$\begin{array}{l}
\bigwedge_{s\in Sorts(\Sigma^M)} \forall x:{\iota(s)},y:{\iota(s)}.h(x)\EEQ h(y)\implies P_s(x, y)\\
\bigwedge \land_{p_w\in\Sigma^M} \forall \bar{x}:{\iota(w)}.\iota(p:w)(\bar{x})
\implies P_{p:w}(\bar{x})
\end{array}
$$


\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}

The models of the nodes $N$ and $N'$ are
the same.

\end{proposition}%\ednote{AR: Proof in appendix?}

{\noindent\it Proof.}
%
Let $n$ be a $N$-model. To prove that $n$ is also a $N'$-model,
we need to show that it has a $K$-expansion.

Let us define the following $\Sigma_K$ model, denoted $k$:

\begin{itemize}

\item on $\Sigma_M$, $k$ coincides with $n$;

\item on $\iota(\Sigma_M)$, the interpretation of sorts and function symbols 
is given by the free types axioms (i.e. sorts are interpreted as set of terms, 
operations $\iota(f)$ map terms $t_1,..t_n$ to the term
$\iota(f)(t_1,..,t_n)$).  We define interpretation of predicates after defining $h$;

\item $make$ assigns to each $x$ the term $make(x)$;

\item the homomorphism $h$ is defined inductively as follows:

 \begin{itemize}

  \item $h(make(x)) = x$, if $x \in n_s$ and $s\in Sorts(\Sigma)$;

 \item $h(make(t)) = h(t)$, otherwise;

 \item $h(\iota(f)(t_1,..t_n))$ is defined iff $f(h(t_1), ..h(t_n))$ is defined in $n$
          and then  $h(\iota(f)(t_1,..t_n)) = f(h(t_1), ..h(t_n))$;
 \end{itemize}

\item for predicates in $\iota(\Sigma_M)$ we define
         $\iota(p)(t_1,..t_n)$ iff $p(h(t_1),..,h(t_n))$.

\end{itemize}

Notice that the first three types of axioms of the node $K$ hold by construction and also
notice that $ker(h)$ satisfies $Th(M)$ because $n$ is a $M$-model.
The surjectivity of $h$ and the minimality of $ker(h)$ are exactly the
``no junk'' and the ``no confusion'' properties of the free model $n$.  

For the other inclusion, let $n'$ be a model of $N'$, $n_0$ be its $\Sigma$-reduct and
$k'$ a $K$-expansion of $n'$.
Using the fact that the theory of $M$ is in Horn form, we get an expansion of $n_0$ to a
$\sigma$-free model $n$. We have seen that all free models are also models of $N'$ and moreover
we have seen that $ker(k_h)$ is the least predicative congruence satisfying $Th(M)$. The free types 
axioms of $K$ fix the interpretation of $\iota(\Sigma_M)$ and therefore $ker(k'_h)$ and
$ker(k_h)$ are both minimal on the same set, and must be the same. This and the surjectivity
of $k_h$ and $k'_h$ allow us to define easily
an isomorphism between $n$ and $n'$ and because $n'$ is isomorphic with a free model it must be free as well.
