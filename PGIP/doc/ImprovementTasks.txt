This file collects Klaus improvement suggestions and tasks for the
PGIP interface implementation.

PGIP/ProveCommands.hs
---------------------

 * avoid code duplication:
   - generalise function Proofs.InferBasic.getProvers with an
     additional ProverKind argument and import this function for the
     implementation of getProversCMDLautomatic
   - markProved

   a good place for both functions maybe Proofs.GUIState 

 * discuss how to generalise Proofs.InferBasic splitting the GUI stuff
   from the real computation 

 * discuss which parts of GUI.ProofManagement need to be genralised
   for the CMDL prove interface
