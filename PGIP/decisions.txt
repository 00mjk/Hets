Attention
  For some reasons it does not compile if the old version
is also presented in the folder so please deleted. You can
use the clean.sh script to do this.

List of decisions taken while implementing the PGIP/CMDL 
interface:

 - autocomplete edge names using only the canonical form
   (i.e. name1_->_name2, only one space between words)


Question : 
   Use all nodes or all edges for autocomplete or only
   goals edges, goals nodes?
