Attention
  For some reasons it does not compile if the old version
is also presented in the folder so please deleted. You can
use the clean.sh script to do this.

List of decisions taken while implementing the PGIP/CMDL 
interface:

 - autocomplete edge names using only the canonical form
   (i.e. name1_->_name2, only one space between words)



Commands separation :

  Use

  all dg commands except dg basic/select/dg-all basic/select all
  nodes
  edges
  most info commands

  select/dg basic/select all/dg-all basic

  set/add/del commands 
  some info commands

  prove / prove-all
