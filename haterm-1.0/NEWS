Release 1.0 of The Haskell ATerm Library  is now available from

  http://www.cwi.nl/~jvisser/downloads/haterm-1.0.tar.gz

This package provides support for ATerms in Haskell. Currently this
includes the following:

  * Representation of ATerms                    (no sharing)
  * Reading and writing ATerms to/from Strings  (plain text and TAF)
  * Conversion betweens ATerms and user types   (marshalling)

For marshalling user types to/from ATerms, instances of the class
ATermConvertible must be provided. The pre-compiler DrIFT from the
Strafunski distribution can be used to generate such instances
automatically from your datatype definitions. You can get the
Strafunski version of DrIFT from:

Feedback is much appreciated!
