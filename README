This README belongs to a "The heterogeneous tool set" (Hets) source
release created by "make release" from the original svn repository.
(for svn see http://subversion.tigris.org/)

The original svn sources can be obtained by:
svn co https://svn-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de/Hets/trunk Hets

Information not contained here can be found in the Hets user guide
(doc/UserGuide.pdf) or on the Hets web page www.dfki.de/sks/hets.

The subject of this source release is to create a binary "hets" that
is able to analyse heterogeneous and in particular CASL
specifications.

The sources need to be compiled using ghc Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(www.haskell.org/ghc) version 6.8.3! Haskell as a logic is also
a part of Hets via "Programatica"
(www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/programatica).

Beside output written to the console (stdout) or to files, hets can
display graphs using "uDraw(Graph)", formerly "daVinci"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph)

Additionally, in particular for the binding to uDrawGraph,
the sources of the uniform workbench are required:
https://svn-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uni/trunk

For hets (and uni) to find "uDrawGraph", the environment variables UDG_HOME and
UNIDAVINCI must be set to the installation directory of uDraw(Graph) and to
the actual executable, respectively.

export UNIDAVINCI=$UDG_HOME/bin/uDrawGraph

A typical call of hets is then: hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl

Example specifications can be found under:
https://svn-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de/Hets-lib/trunk

If you need to build the hets binary follow the instructions in
INSTALL, alternatively try to get a binary or a complete installer from:
www.dfki.de/sks/hets/installation_e.htm

The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is mainly maintained by
Christian Maeder (Christian.Maeder@dfki.de) and
Till Mossakowski (Till.Mossakowski@dfki.de).

The mailing list is hets-devel@informatik.uni-bremen.de.
