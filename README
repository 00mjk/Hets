This README belongs to a Hets release (and does not apply to
sources directly obtained via cvs).

The subject of this release is a binary "hets" that is able to analyse
heterogeneous and in particular CASL specifications.
The sources need to be compiled with ghc Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(www.haskell.org/ghc).

The output of hets, if the input is successfully accepted, can be
displayed by "daVinci".

daVinci is maintained by b-novative and b-novative holds all rights.
This release may be accompanied with free binary releases of daVinci
Version 2.1, but daVinci 2.1 is no longer supported or maintained!
However, you are encouraged to obtain the latest version of daVinci
Presenter (currently 3.0.5) from http://www.b-novative.com that is
free for academic purposes.

Linux: the linux binary release of daVinci 2.1 relies on the old
shlibs5 that must be installed on your system (if ./daVinci cannot be
found/executed, then shlibs5 are missing)

Solaris: the solaris binary release of daVinci 2.1 should work without
problems

Macintosh (Darwin): there is no release of daVinci for Macintosh, but
b-novative may have one in the mean time

For best quality, get the latest version of daVinci from b-novative.

For hets to find daVinci, the environment variables DAVINCIHOME and
UNIDAVINCI must be set to the installation directory of daVinci and to
the actual executable, respectively. 

export DAVINCIHOME=<path>/daVinci_V2.1
export UNIDAVINCI=<path>/daVinci_V2.1/daVinci

A typical call of hets is then: <path>/hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl

If you need to rebuild the hets binary follow the instructions in INSTALL
(This README belongs a to release created by "make release", in case
that you obtained the HetCATS sources as CVS tree)

The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is mainly maintained by
Christian Maeder (maeder@tzi.de) and Till Mossakowski
(till@tzi.de). The mailing list is hets@tzi.de.
