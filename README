This README belongs to a "The heterogeneous tool set" (Hets) release
(and does not apply to sources directly obtained via cvs).

Information not contained here can be found in the Hets user guide
(doc/UserGuide.pdf) or on the Hets web page
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cofi/hets).

The subject of this release is a binary "hets" that is able to analyse
heterogeneous and in particular CASL specifications.

The sources need to be compiled with ghc Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(www.haskell.org/ghc) version 6.6! Haskell is also a part of Hets via
"Programatica" (www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/programatica).

Beside output written to the console (stdout) or to files hets, can
display graphs using "uDraw(Graph)", formerly "daVinci"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph)

For hets to find "uDrawGraph", the environment variables UDG_HOME and
UNIDAVINCI must be set to the installation directory of uDraw(Graph) and to
the actual executable, respectively.

export UNIDAVINCI=$UDG_HOME/bin/uDrawGraph

A typical call of hets is then: hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl

If you need to rebuild the hets binary follow the instructions in INSTALL
(This README belongs a to release created by "make release", in case
that you obtained the HetCATS sources as CVS tree)

The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is mainly maintained by
Christian Maeder (Christian.Maeder@dfki.de) and Till Mossakowski
(till@informatik.uni-bremen.de).
The mailing list is hets-devel@informatik.uni-bremen.de.
