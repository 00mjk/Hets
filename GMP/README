Notes

The modal indexes are allowed to be only strings containing letters - at the moment - (any other thing will result in a parsing error).
The binding order "~" >> "/\" >> "\/" >> "<-" = "->" = "<->" is not set yet.
The following tests contain eronated formulae:
    test03
    test07
    test08
    test09
    test10
