Eronated tests (string-index) formulae:   2,3,7,8,9,10
                integer
                bit-string                15

Good tests (string-index) formulae:       0,1,2,4,5,6,11,12
            integer                       13, 14, 15
            bit-string                    14

Tests 16 -> 19 are for step 1 in the decidability algorithm
