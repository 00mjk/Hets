Notes

The modal indexes are allowed to be only strings containing letters - at the moment - (any other thing will result in a parsing error).
The binding order "~" >> "/\" >> "\/" >> "<-" = "->" = "<->" is not set yet.

Eronated tests (string-index) formulae:   3,7,8,9,10
                integer
                bit-string                15

Good tests (string-index) formulae:       1,2,4,5,6,11,12
            integer                       13, 15
            bit-string                    14
