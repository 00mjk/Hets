 - adapt to Programatica
 - possibly recover a version for hatchet (and read imports only once)

Logical.hs is unused

Nothing in Haskell should refer to the subdirectory Hatchet. For this
purpose a new toplevel directory Hatchet exists.

In Hatchet imports (List, Monad, Char, IO, CPUTime) should be all qualified. 
Hatchet depends (weakly) on Common.Lib.Pretty, Common.DFiniteMap.
Digraph is not used (but Data.Graph and Data.Tree instead).
