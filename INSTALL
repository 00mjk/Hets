For the graph display with uDrawGraph we rely on "uni"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uniform/wb).

For compilation the Glagow Haskell Compiler (haskell.org/ghc) Version
6.0.1 or higher is required (ghc-6.4 does not work under solaris
currently).

In order to build "hets" from sources using GHC, the uni library must
have been installed (as described by uni/README) with the same version
of ghc. The uni version for ghc-6.2.x or ghc-6.0.x must be checked out
with the tag "ghc-6-02" (the HEAD is for ghc-6.4). "HetCATS" and "uni"
must reside in the same directory. Additionally a "programatica"
directory may be there. (We use slightly modified files, so ask us.)

Ideally, the binary "hets" is produced be a simple call of "make" in
the directory HetCATS. ("gmake" on solars!)

Note, however, that a source release (created by "make release")
contains generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some
files are generated by the tools "DrIFT" and "genRules" and these
utilities are also Haskell programs that can be easily compiled from
source. Two files are generated by the "happy" parser generator, that
is not part of a HetCATS release. Documentation may be generated using
"haddock" and/or latex.

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained by cvs. For a release the file "ReleaseMakefile"
overwrites the "Makefile" from cvs.
