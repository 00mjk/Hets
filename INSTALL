For the graph display with uDrawGraph we rely on "uni"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uniform/wb).

For compilation the Glasgow Haskell Compiler "ghc" Version
6.4.1 or 6.4.2 is required.

In order to build "hets" from sources using GHC, the uni library must
have been installed (as described by uni/README) with the same version
of ghc. "HetCATS" and "uni" must reside in the same
directory. Additionally - if you want a mini-logic Haskell - a
"programatica" directory may be there.

From 
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbkb/forschung/formal_methods/CoFI/hets/src-distribution/versions/

the files uni-ghc-6.4.x-2006-02-01.tgz, programatica-2006-08-01.tgz
and a recent Hets-src.tgz snapshot may be obtained (if you don't want
to check from cvs repositories). 

Ideally, the binary "hets" is produced be a simple call of "make" in
the directory HetCATS. Use "gmake" under solaris! Rather than building
the binary yourself, you may try out one of our recently created
binaries (compressed with bzip2) for linux, solaris or mac.

Examples for testing can be obtained from 
http://www.cofi.info/Libraries/lib.tgz
Try out i.e. "hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl" to see if the graphical interface
pops up. If this does not work, maybe "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1) from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph
is not properly installed.

Note, however, that a source release (created by "make release")
contains generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some
files are generated by the tools (i.e. like "DrIFT"); these utilities
are also Haskell programs.  For programatica the "happy" parser
generator (Version 1.15), that is not part of a HetCATS release, is
needed unless you got our file programatica-2006-08-01.tgz. A source
release already contains html documentation of our modules. In order
to generate the documentation from cvs sources you'll need "haddock"
(Version 0.7).

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained via cvs. For a release the ReleaseMakefile
overwrites the Makefile from cvs. The original Makefile is renamed
to Makefile.orig.
