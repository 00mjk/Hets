For the graph display with uDrawGraph we rely on "uni"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uniform/wb).

For compilation the Glasgow Haskell Compiler "ghc" Version
6.6 is required. (ghc-6.4.2 is sufficient if "hets.o" is deleted from
the (Release)Makefile)

In order to build "hets" from sources using GHC, the "uni" library
must have been installed. "uni" for ghc-6.6 (branch: ghc-6-06) relies
on HaXml-1.13.2.

HaXml-1.13.2 should be installed as cabal package using:
runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=`pwd`
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install 
# or
runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

Within uni call:
./configure
make packages
# and optional
./runhaddock.sh

"HetCATS" and "uni" must reside in the same
directory. Additionally - if you want a mini-logic Haskell - a
"programatica" directory may be there.

From 
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbkb/forschung/formal_methods/CoFI/hets/src-distribution/versions/

recent snapshots of "uni", "programatica" and the "hets" sources may be
obtained (if you don't want to check out from cvs repositories).

The binary "hets" should be produced by:

make -f Makefile.orig packages
make depend
make hets 
# this takes a while

Use "gmake" under solaris! Rather than building
the binary yourself, you may try out one of our recently created
binaries (compressed with bzip2) for linux, solaris or mac.

Examples for testing can be obtained from 
http://www.cofi.info/Libraries/lib.tgz
Try out i.e. "hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl" to see if the graphical interface
pops up. If this does not work, maybe "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1) from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph
is not properly installed.

Note, however, that a source release (created by "make release")
contains generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some
files are generated by the tools (i.e. like "DrIFT"); these utilities
are also Haskell programs.  For programatica the "happy" parser
generator (Version 1.15), that is not part of a HetCATS release. A source
release already contains html documentation of our modules. In order
to generate the documentation from cvs sources you'll need "haddock"
(Version 0.8).

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained via cvs. For a release the ReleaseMakefile
overwrites the Makefile from cvs. The original Makefile is renamed
to Makefile.orig.
