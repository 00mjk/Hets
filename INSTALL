For the graph display with uDrawGraph we rely on "uni"
(www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uniform/wb).
svn co https://svn-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uni/trunk uni

For compilation the Glasgow Haskell Compiler "ghc" Version
6.8.2 is required! (ghc-6.6.1 with Cabal-1.2.2.0 may work, too) 

In order to build "hets" from sources using GHC, the "uni" library
must have been installed. "uni" relies on the
environment variable UDG_HOME pointing to the "uDrawGraph"
installation (when calling ./configure in "uni").

A binary distribution of "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1)
from http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph only needs to be
unpacked.

Within uni call:
./configure
make cabal
# and optional
./runhaddock.sh

"Hets" and "uni" must reside in the same
directory. Additionally - if you want a mini-logic Haskell - a
"programatica" directory may be there. (The file
utils/nightly/cronjob.sh contains the lines how to check out programatica.)

From
http://www.dfki.de/sks/hets/src-distribution/versions/

recent snapshots of "uni", "programatica" and the "hets" sources may be
obtained (if you don't want to check out from cvs or svn
repositories).

You may also install HaXml-1.13.2 or HaXml-1.13.3 in order to generate
comptable.xml output.

The binary "hets" should be produced by:

make -f Makefile.orig packages
make depend
make hets
# this takes a while

Use "gmake" (and "gtar" for unpacking) under solaris!

Rather than building the binary yourself, you may try out one of our
nightly created binaries (compressed with bzip2) or our installers.

Examples for testing can be obtained from
http://www.cofi.info/Libraries/lib.tgz
Try out i.e. "hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl" to see if the graphical interface
pops up. If this does not work, maybe "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1) from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph
is not properly installed. If UDG_HOME was not properly set during
installation of "uni", setting UNIDAVINCI to the "uDrawGraph" binary
may help.

Note, however, that a source release (created by "make release")
contains generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some
files are generated by tools (i.e. like "DrIFT"); these utilities
are also Haskell programs.  For programatica the "happy" parser
generator (Version 1.15), that is not part of a Hets release. A source
release already contains html documentation of our modules. In order
to generate the documentation from svn sources you'll need "haddock"
(Version 0.8).

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained via svn. For a release the ReleaseMakefile
overwrites the Makefile from svn. The original Makefile is renamed
to Makefile.orig.
