For the graph display with uDrawGraph we rely on "uni"
  svn co https://svn-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uni/trunk uni

For compilation we use the Glasgow Haskell Compiler "ghc" Version
6.10.1!

In order to build "hets" from sources using GHC, the "uni" library
should have been installed. "uni" relies on the
environment variable UDG_HOME pointing to the "uDrawGraph"
installation (when calling ./configure in "uni").

A binary distribution of "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1)
from http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph only needs to be
unpacked.

Within uni call:
  ./configure
  make cabal

Additionally - if you want a mini-logic Haskell - a "programatica" should be
checked out or unpacked in the same parent directory where Hets resided. (The
file utils/nightly/cronjob.sh contains the lines how to check out
programatica.)

From http://www.dfki.de/sks/hets/src-distribution/versions/
recent snapshots of "uni", "programatica" and the "hets" sources may be
obtained (if you don't want to check out from cvs or svn
repositories).

The binary "hets" should be produced from a source distribution by:

  make -f Makefile.orig packages
  make depend
  make hets
  # this takes a while

Use "gmake" (and "gtar" for unpacking) under solaris!

When building hets directly from svn sources, just call "make" and install
further ghc packages if errors occur.

Installing HAIFA is a bit tricky, since it relies on hxt-filter-8.2.0
which in turn relies on HTTP-3001.1.x but tries to grab HTTP-4000.0.x

  cabal install hxt-filter-8.2.0 --preference=HTTP==3001.1.5

Rather than building the binary yourself, you may try out one of our
nightly created binaries (compressed with bzip2) or our installers.

Examples for testing can be obtained from
http://www.cofi.info/Libraries/lib.tgz
Try out i.e. "hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl" to see if the graphical interface
pops up. If this does not work, maybe "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1) from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph
is not properly installed. If UDG_HOME was not properly set during
installation of "uni", setting UNIDAVINCI to the "uDrawGraph" binary
may help. (Or make sure "uDrawGraph" can be found in your PATH.)

Note, however, that a source release (created by "make release") contains
generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some files are
generated by tools (i.e. like "DrIFT"); these utilities are also Haskell
programs.  For programatica the "happy" parser generator (Version 1.15) is
needed, that is not part of a Hets release. A source release already contains
html documentation of our modules. In order to generate the documentation from
svn sources you'll need "haddock" that comes with ghc.

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained via svn. For a release the ReleaseMakefile
overwrites the Makefile from svn. The original Makefile is renamed
to Makefile.orig.
