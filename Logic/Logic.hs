Central interface (type class) for logics in Hets

Provides data structures for logics (with symbols). Logics are
   a type class with an /identity type/ (usually interpreted
   by a singleton set) which serves to treat logics as
   data. All the functions in the type class take the
   identity as first argument in order to determine the logic.

   For logic (co)morphisms see "Logic.Comorphism"

   This module uses multiparameter type classes
   (<http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/type-extensions.html#multi-param-type-classes>)
   with functional dependencies (<http://haskell.org/hawiki/FunDeps>)
   for defining an interface for the notion of logic. Multiparameter type
   classes are needed because a logic consists of a collection of types,
   together with operations on these. Functional dependencies
   are needed because no operation will involve all types of
   the multiparameter type class; hence we need a method to derive
   the missing types. We chose an easy way: for each logic, we
   introduce a new singleton type that is the name, or constitutes the identity
   of the logic. All other types of the multiparameter type class
   depend on this /identity constituting/ type, and all operations take
   the 'identity constituting' type as first arguments. The value
   of the argument of the /identity constituting/ type is irrelevant
   (note that there is only one value of such a type anyway).

   Note that we tend to use @lid@ both for the /identity type/
   of a logic, as well as for its unique inhabitant, i.e. @lid :: lid@.

   The other types involved in the definition of logic are as follows:

   * sign: signatures, that is, contexts, or non-logical vocabularies,
   typically consisting of a set of declared sorts, predicates,
   function symbols, propositional letters etc., together with their
   typing.

   * sentence: logical formulas.

   * basic_spec: abstract syntax of basic specifications. The latter are
   human-readable presentations of a signature together with some sentences.

   * symbol: symbols that may occur in a signature, fully qualified
   with their types

   * raw_symbol:  symbols that may occur in a signature, possibly not
   or partially qualified

   * morphism: maps between signatures (typically preserving the structure).

   * symb_items: abstract syntax of symbol lists, used for declaring some
   symbols of a signature as hidden.

   * symb_map_items: abstract syntax of symbol maps, i.e. human-readable
   presentations of signature morphisms.

   * sublogics: sublogics of the given logic. This type might be a
   record of Boolean flags, indicating whether some feature is
   present in the sublogi of not.

   * proof_tree: proof trees.

{- static analysis
   This type class provides the data needed for an institution with symbols,
   as explained in the structured specification semantics in the CASL
   reference manual, chapter III.4.
   The static analysis computes signatures from basic specifications,
   and signature morphisms from symbol lists and symbol maps. The latter
   needs an intermediate stage, so-called raw symbols, which are possibly
   unqualified symbols. Normal symbols are always fully qualified.
   In the CASL reference manual, our symbols are called "signature symbols",
   and our raw symbols are called "symbols". (Terminology should be adapted.)

{- Type class logic. The central type class of Hets, providing the
   interface for logics. This type class is instantiated for many logics,
   and it is used for the logic independent parts of Hets.
   It hence provides an sbatraction barrier between logic specific and
   logic indepdendent code.
   This type class extends the class StaticAnalysis by a sublogic mechanism.
   Sublogics are important since they avoid the need to provide an own
   instance of the class logic for each sublogic. Instead, the sublogic
   can use the datastructures and operations of the main logic, and
   functions are provided to test whether a given item lies within the
   sublogic. Also, projection functions from a super-logic to a sublogic
   are provided.
