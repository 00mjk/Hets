\section{Preliminaries}

Make sure a new version (currently 5.04.1) of \texttt{ghc}
(www.haskell.org) is properly installed.  Also
\texttt{/usr/local/bin/perl, /usr/local/bin/bash} and \texttt{GNU
  make} are required.

\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Check out}
The latest versions of all sources should be checked out in the top
directory \texttt{HetCATS/} using:

\texttt{cvs up -d}

(use option \texttt{-d} to also get new directories)

\subsection{(Pre-)Compile}

\texttt{cd HetCATS/hetcats} and call \texttt{make} (on Linux) or
\texttt{gmake} (on Solaris). To fully recompile everything call
\texttt{gmake distclean} before. Files with extensions
\texttt{*.\{d,o,hi\}} are intermediate compilation results.

One important effect is that \texttt{*.der.hs} files will be
``drifted'', i.e.  from \texttt{*.der.hs} files actual haskell source
files (\texttt{*.hs}) are created that include extra code for
instances (of class \texttt{PosItem}) derived by DrIFT (a
\texttt{perl}-script in \texttt{HetCATS/utils/}).

\subsection{Compiling the CASL parser}

\texttt{cd HetCATS/CASL} and call \texttt{./ghc-call} (a script that
contains all necessary ghc options and parameters).

This creates a binary called \texttt{capa} that can parse (and pretty
print) ``Basic Specification with Subsorts'' of the CASL Summary
version 1.0.1 \\ (www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/Summary/).

Structured specifications can not be parsed yet.

Note: if module \texttt{AS\_Basic\_CASL} can not be found
\texttt{AS\_Basic\_CASL.hs} was not ``drifted'' (see above). Most
\texttt{AS\_*} files have extension \texttt{.der.hs} and need to
be drifted.

\subsection{Testing}

A test call might be: 

\texttt{./capa BasicSpec.casl}

The binary \texttt{capa} is also used to test various subordinate (and
mixfix) parsers. Test cases are given as \texttt{*.casl} files.

Calling \texttt{./runcheck.sh} performs many tests and compares the
results with corresponding \texttt{*.output} files.

\texttt{Wrong*.casl} files contain wrong CASL code and should produce
error messages. Apart from extra tests, correct (\texttt{Bla.casl})
and wrong files (\texttt{WrongBla.casl}) are tested. The number e of
``\texttt{error}'' occurrences (in the produced ouput) is compared to the
number of input lines. If e is zero or is equal to the number of lines
then the test is silently regarded as ok, otherwise an additional message
is produced that can be ignored provided the internal call to
\texttt{diff} succeeded and ``\texttt{passed}'' was emitted.

Calling ``\texttt{./runcheck.sh set}'' will update the \texttt{*.output} files (and a subsequent \texttt{./runcheck.sh} should always pass).

\section{Structure of source files}

\subsection{Directory \texttt{HetCATS/CASL}}

\subsubsection*{Parser related files}

\begin{description}
\item[Main.hs] simply lists the test parsers 
\item[RunParsers.hs] contains the driver called in Main for test parsers and is reused in \texttt{HetCATS/HasCASL}
\item[RunMixfixParser.hs] is an additional driver to test the mixfix analysis
\item[MixfixParser.hs] uses precedence and associativity to resolve
  mixfix terms (and formulae). Also \%list, \%string, \%number and
  \%floating annotations are resolved. 
\item[AS\_Basic\_CASL.hs] defines the abstract syntax tree for CASL
\item[Print\_AS\_Basic.hs] pretty prints data types of
  \texttt{AS\_Basic\_CASL.hs}
\item[Parse\_AS\_Basic.hs] supplies the top-level parsers \texttt{basicSpec,
  basicItems, dotFormulae} and \texttt{sigItems}
\item[TypeItem.hs] parsers \texttt{datatype} and \texttt{typeItems}
\item[OpItem.hs] parsers \texttt{opItem(s)} and \texttt{predItem(s)}
\item[SortItem.hs] parser \texttt{sortItem(s)} (requires \texttt{Formula.hs} for subsort definitions)
\item[ItemList.hs] parses items (separated by semicolons) generically
  (\texttt{itemList}) and annotations between or following these
  items. It depends on \texttt{annotationL} from
  \texttt{HetCATS/Anno\_Parser.hs}.
\item[SymbolParser.hs] parses symbols and symbol maps that are not
  needed for basic specs but for heterogeneous structured
  specifications only (see \texttt{Logic\_CASL.hs})
\item[Formula.hs] parser \texttt{term} and \texttt{formula}
\item[Token.hs] generic parser for mixfix ids and some keyword parsers
  (reused in \texttt{HetCATS/HasCASL}). The haskell data types
  \texttt{Token} and \texttt{Id} are defined in \texttt{HetCATS/Id.hs}!
\item[Lexer.hs] various scanners and extensions of the Parsec library 
\item[Keywords.hs] CASL keywords as named identifiers (to be used
  for parsing and printing and thus ensuring consistent spellings)
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Dependencies to the parent and other directories}
\label{sec:casl}

The above files rely on the data types in \texttt{Id.hs} and
\texttt{AS\_Annotation.hs} in the parent directory. For pretty
printing the class in \texttt{PrettyPrint.hs} is required.
\texttt{PrettyPrint.hs} in turn relies on
\texttt{GlobalAnnotations.hs} and
\texttt{pretty/LaTeX\_funs.hs} (to consider \%display
annotations). \texttt{pretty/Pretty.lhs} is an adapted copy of
\texttt{//research.microsoft.com/\~{}simonpj/downloads/pretty-printer/pretty.html}
that is also included as Haskell (\texttt{package -text}) library. (So
don't include this package.)

\texttt{PrettyPrint.hs} supplies an instance for \texttt{Id}. The
instance for annotations is given in \texttt{Print\_AS\_Annotation.hs}.
\texttt{CASL/Print\_AS\_Basic} further imports \texttt{PPUtils.hs}.

\texttt{GlobalAnnotations.hs} contains the \texttt{PrecedenceGraph} and
imports \texttt{FiniteMap} from the Haskell (\texttt{package -data})
library and \texttt{fgl/Graph.hs} that (unfortunately) has its
own implementation of maps, namely
\texttt{fgl/SimpleMap.hs}. 
FGL comes from \texttt{www.cs.orst.edu/\~{}erwig/fgl/}

In conjunction with \texttt{GlobalAnnotations.hs} also
\texttt{GlobalAnnotationsFunctions.hs} is sometimes needed. The later
depends on \texttt{GraphUtils.hs}. 

\texttt{CASL/MixfixParser.hs} uses \texttt{Result.hs} to combine
diagnostic messages.

The actually parser combinators come from 
\texttt{www.cs.uu.nl/\~{}daan/parsec.html} that are part of the
Haskell library but also have been slightly extended (by
\texttt{consumeNothing}) and included in the \texttt{parsec/}
subdirectory. \texttt{Parsec.hs} simply reexports parts from
\texttt{ParsecPrim.hs}, \texttt{ParsecCombinator.hs},
\texttt{ParsecChar.hs}, \texttt{ParsecError.hs} and
\texttt{ParsecPos.hs}

\texttt{Anno\_Parser.hs} has its own parser for mixfix \texttt{Id}s based on
\texttt{<CaslLanguage.hs} that in turn is based on
\texttt{parsec/ParsecToken.hs} and \texttt{parsec/ParsecLanguage.hs}.
\texttt{Anno\_Parser.hs} further uses \texttt{parsec/ParsecPerm.hs}
and \texttt{Utils.hs}.

\subsubsection*{Other \texttt{*.hs} files in \texttt{HetCATS/CASL}}

\begin{description}
\item[Sign.hs] describes signatures after the static analysis
\item[Static.hs] computes the above signatures
\item[Logic\_CASL.hs] supplies an instance for \texttt{HetCATS/Logic.hs}
\item[Sublogics.hs] is used in \texttt{Logic\_CASL.hs}
\end{description}
 
\texttt{MixfixParser.hs} operates only on \texttt{FORMULA} and
\texttt{TERM} from \texttt{AS\_Basic\_CASL.der.hs} and not on
\texttt{Sign.hs}. 

Typechecking (considering subtypes and overloading) of terms and
formulae (plus their conversions to the types in \texttt{Sign.hs}) is
still missing.

\subsection{Top-level directory \texttt{HetCATS}}

The subdirectories \texttt{utils} (for DriFT), \texttt{hetcats} (for
the final application), \texttt{pretty}, \texttt{parsec}, \texttt{fgl}
have been mentioned above.

\begin{description}

\end{description}

The top-level directory contains the abstract syntax trees for
heterogeneous specifications: \texttt{AS\_Atructured}, \texttt{AS\_Architecture} and \texttt{AS\_Library}

For the above \texttt{AS\_*.der.hs} files corresponding pretty
printers \texttt{Print\_AS\_*.hs} are given.

  types in \texttt{Grothendieck}
\item[LogicRepr.hs] is an extension of \texttt{Logic.hs} and includes
  composition of logic representation (not used?)
\item[LogicGraph.hs] gives a graph of logic representations (not used?)
\item[LogicStructured.hs] has something to do with sublogics (Pascal, Till?)
\item[P\_user\_state.hs] is intended (as user state of parsec
  combinators) for heterogeneous parsing (Klaus)
\item[Parse\_AS\_Structured.hs] is the unfinished start of a heterogeneous
  parser without user state (Christian)
\item[Print\_HetCASL.hs] applies functions form \texttt{Print\_AS\_Library}
\item[Prover.hs] is one subdivision of \texttt{Logic.hs}
\item[test\_parser.hs] contains a \texttt{main} to test the differences
  between the two \texttt{Id} parsers (from Christian's
  \texttt{CASL/Token.hs} and Klaus's \texttt{Anno\_Parser.hs}).
\end{description}

The other files \texttt{AS\_Annotation.der.hs},
\texttt{CaslLanguage.hs}, \texttt{Id.hs}, \texttt{Result.hs},
\texttt{GraphUtils.hs}, \texttt{PPUtils.hs}, \texttt{PrettyPrint.hs},
