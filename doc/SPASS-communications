General format of SPASS output
- input clauses
- reduced clauses
- clauses selected by the "given clause" algorithm
   (usable clauses are successively processed an marked as worked off.
    If the set of usable clauses is empty, a completion has been found)
- proof

Format of clauses
Clause[split level]justification.literal number
(the split level denotes a specific branch in a tableaux proof)
*  literal is maximal in the ordering
** ... and additionally it is an equation, oriented from left to right
+ (negative) literal has been selected

MPI:
- cache CNF computations for optimized skolemization
  (workaround until this is fixed: disable optimized skolemization)
- allow U as predicate name
- CNF translation shuold output info 
    about relation between input axioms and clauses
- treatment of sorted equations
- does it help to mark theorems (that follow from the rest)?
- send SPASS 2.7

Bremen:
- adapt CASL2SPASS translation
  - exists! x. phi(x) should become 
    (exists x. phi(x)) /\ (forall x,y . phi(x) /\ phi(y) => x=y)
  - in case of a conjunctive goal, send conjuncts individually
  - eliminate user defined equality predicates
  - eliminate (some?) subsort definitions, like in RRCDagstuhl.het
  - if there is only one sort, eliminate it
- send interesting example with a modular theory 
   -> could be saturated per module
   -> research paper
- send example with a finite sort
- send example with a single sort (e.g. optimized RCCDagsthul)
- send ontology example (DOLCE)
