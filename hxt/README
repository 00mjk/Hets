These are the plain sources of the Haskell XML Toolbox (HXT) with some
slight modifications over version 4.02. The building of a separate
package is skipped and the whole src tree is used directly.

INTRODUCTION
============

The Haskell XML Toolbox is a collection of tools for processing XML with
Haskell.

The core component of the Haskell XML Toolbox is a validating XML-Parser, which
supports almost fully the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition).

The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML, but introduces a
more general approach for processing XML with Haskell. The Haskell XML Toolbox
uses a generic data model for representing XML documents, including the DTD
subset and the document subset, in Haskell. This data model makes is possible to
use filter functions as uniform design of XML processing applications. The whole
XML parser of the Haskell XML Toolbox was implemented using this design.
Libraries with filters and combinators are provided for processing the generic
data model.

The Haskell XML Toolbox is available from:
    http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/

The current version is 4.02, and is stable quality.

The Haskell XML Toolbox was developed with Hugs Version December 2001 (later with ghci) and with
Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) 5.04, 6.01 and 6.2 on Linux systems. Testing on Windows systems
has not been done yet.

Please contact us (hxmltoolbox@fh-wedel.de) with any questions, comments, or bug
reports.

FEATURES
========

- Unicode and UTF-8, US-ASCII and ISO-Laitin-1 support
- http: and file: protocol support
- http access via proxy
- http support build in or via external program curl for HTTP/1.1 support
- wellformed document parsing and validation
- support for namespaces
- xpath support

MISSING FEATURES AND KNOWN PROBLEMS
===================================

Known problems:
- Line numbers are not always pointing to the source of syntax error
- Line numbers are not yet reported for validity constraint errors.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Documentation in various formats is available in the 'doc' subdirectory.

The source code is documented with Haddock

The master's thesis "Design and Implementation of a validating XML parser in
Haskell" by Martin Schmidt describes the design and motivation of the Haskell
XML Toolbox


INSTALLATION
============

To compile binary versions of the programs included in the Haskell XML Toolbox
the "Glasgow Haskell Compiler" >= 6.2 and "GNU make" are needed.

execute in this dir

	make all

for testing the distribution with the example programs try

	make test

for installing the software in the ghc package dir run (with root access)

	make install

for uninstalling the package run (with root access)

	make uninstall

for using the toolbox include

	module XXX(...)
	where
	...
	import Text.XML.HXT.Parser
	...

and compile with

	ghc ... -package hxt ...

for using the package with ghci set option

	ghci> :set -package hxt


good luck
