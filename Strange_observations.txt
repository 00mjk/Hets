and debugging 'hetcats'.

20.Jun.2002: - A loop occures if some instances are used but not
               linked together with the binary. It is not sufficient
               to give the context for a type class. You must yorself
               find the modules that define those instances that are
               requested by the context of a typeclass. 
	       my example:
	       Without the import of Print_AS_Basic in
               CASL/Logic_CASL.hs the whole system compiles and links
               very well, but you cannot run the code. It fails with
               '<<loop>>'.

	     - If the context 'Show basic_spec' is omitted at the
               definition of class Syntax in Logic.hs, a loop at
               runtime is reported whenever you run a show on a
               basic_spec.
