{-- type classes and sorts --}

{-  Classes denote (possibly empty) collections of types that are
  partially ordered by class inclusion. They are represented
  symbolically by strings.

  Sorts are intersections of finitely many classes. They are
  represented by lists of classes.  Normal forms of sorts are sorted
  lists of minimal classes (wrt. current class inclusion).

  (already defined in Pure/term.ML)

  classrel:
    table representing the proper subclass relation; entries (c, cs)
    represent the superclasses cs of c;

  arities:
    table of association lists of all type arities; (t, ars) means
    that type constructor t has the arities ars; an element (c, Ss) of
    ars represents the arity t::(Ss)c;

{- Instances in Haskell have form:

instance (MyClass a, MyClass b) => MyClass (MyTypeConst a b)

In Isabelle:

instance MyTypeConst :: (MyClass, MyClass) MyClass

Note that the Isabelle syntax does not allows for multi-parameter classes.
Rather, it subsumes the syntax for arities.

Type constraints are applied to value constructors in Haskell as follows:

MyValCon :: (MyClass a, MyClass b) => MyTypeConst a b

In Isabelle:

MyValCon :: MyTypeConst (a::MyClass) (b::MyClass)

In both cases, the typing expressions may be encoded as schemes.
Schemes and instances allows for the inference of type constraints over
values of functions.
