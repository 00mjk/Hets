In the isabelle prompt, type

   use "LOAD.ML";

then

     ThyToOMDoc.ParseTheory "<Path of Theory relative to path you called isabelle from>"

the theory will be automatically loaded if it isn't already
the output will be placed in a file called <TheoryName>.omdoc in the same directory as the theory, or the directory isabelle was called from if the theory was already loaded
