INSTALL
-------

1. The Makefile in this directory runs with gmake on solaris and make
   on linux. But all the paths used are for solaris. In the section
   'Some variables' the configuration can be found and altered.

2. gmake without any target will make a binary called hetcats in this
   directory.

3. If you want to add an own target for testing purposes look at the
   target 'test_parser:' and do similiar things.

4. Files that should go through DrIFT are called
   Module_name.der.hs. And their name should also be added to the
   variable 'drifted_files' without the '.der' part.
