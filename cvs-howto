Getting access to the cvs repository
------------------------------------
Choose a password.

Passwords should contain at least one non-letter.
Passwords must be 6, 7 or 8 characters long.

Using 'encyrpt', encode your password and send it to mawe@tzi.de

The program 'encrpyt' needed to encode your password can be found under
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uniform/wb/cvs/index.html

To encode your password, you also can use 
   /home/till/bin/encrypt
on a Solaris machine (e.g. bob or s01) at the computer science department of 
Uni Bremen.

Checking out the cvs repository
-------------------------------
(note that the lines are sometimes broken by the mail program;
you have to type them on one line)

cvs -d :pserver:XXX@cvs-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de:/repository login
  (enter your passowrd)
cvs -d :pserver:XXX@cvs-agbkb.informatik.uni-bremen.de:/repository co HetCATS

Similarly, check out the repository CASL-lib (usually with a different 
username) and the repository uni (with username cvsread and passwort
cvsread).

The cvs working cycle:
----------------------

1. Enter

cvs up -dP

This updates the sources to the most recent changes made by others.

2. Edit your local copy.

3. If you should have created a new file <filename>.hs, enter a

cvs add <filename>.hs

Otherwise, you can skip this step. (Do not add binaries with this method!)

4. Be sure that the whole thing still goes through "make hets"!
   (if not, go to step 2). Then enter

cvs commit -m "<Some useful message explaining what you have done>"

If no error message appears, you are done and can proceed with 1. or 2.
If the message "up-to-date-check fails" appears, enter

cvs up -d

Don't worry, your local changes will be kept.

If there is no message about conflicts, then cvs could automatically
merge the different changes. You can go to step 4 again.

If there is a message about conflicts, then the respective
files have been edited in parallel at the same position(s) in
two different ways. The two ways are indicated within the files
as follows:

<<<<<<<<<<<
Way1 (your local copy)
===========
Way2 (by some other person)
>>>>>>>>>>>

You have to delete the conflict markers <<<<<<, ===== and >>>>> and merge
the two different ways manually into one.
After you have treated all such conflict markers in all files indicated
by cvs as having conflicts, go to step 4 again.
