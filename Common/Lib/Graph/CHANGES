CHANGES (FGL/HASKELL, Version: September 2002)
----------------------------------------------

September 2002
--------------
* Introduction of graph classes
* Monadic graphs and graph computation monad
* Graph implementation based on balanced (AVL) trees  
* Fast graph implementation based on IO arrays
* New algorithms:
  - Maximum flow
  - Articulation points
  - biconnected components
  - dominators
  - transitive closure
* minor changes in utility functions
  - changed signatures (swapped order of arguments) of 
    functions context and lab to be consistent with other graph functions
  - changed function first in RootPath: not existing path is now reported 
    as an empty list and will not produce an error
  - esp version that returns a list of labeled edges
    (to find minimum label in maxflow algorithm)
  - BFS uses amortized O(1) queue
  - Heap stores key and value separately
  - ...
